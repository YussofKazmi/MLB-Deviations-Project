# MLB Deviations Analysis

## This Project works in three phases, and analyzes every MLB Team from 1871 to 2018
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis - Part 1 - Great Team Performances
### 1.) Calculates the expected win/loss pct for each an every team in the MLB, from the years 1871-2018.
### 2.) List the top 50 teams performances - measured by how many games the team outperformed (more wins) their expected win loss in the given year.

## Analysis - Part 2 - Historically Lucky and Unlucky Teams
### 1.) Calculate the average deviation (in games) between actual performance and expected performance across all years for each team
### 2.) Lists top 10 overperforming teams (actually won more games than expected)
### 3.) Lists top 10 underperforming teams (actually won less games than expected).

## Analysis - Part 3 - Home Field Advantage?
### Now let's see if home field advantage helps teams outperform their expected win/loss totals.
### Lists all teams, and their win stats, and deviations form expected performances during Home and Away games
