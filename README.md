# MLB Deviations Analysis

### This Project works in three phases, and analyzes every MLB Team from 1871 to 2018
#### Implements Pandas and NumPy For Data Cleaning, Aggregation, and Analysis

### Analysis - Part 1 - Great Team Performances
#### 1.) List the top 50 teams performances - measured by how many games the team outperformed (more wins) their expected win loss in the given year.
### Analysis - Part 2 - Historically Lucky and Unlucky Teams
#### 1.) Calculate the average deviation (in games) between actual performance and expected performance across all years for each team
#### 2.) Lists top 10 overperforming teams (actually won more games than expected) and top 10 underperforming teams (actually won less games than expected).
### Analysis - Part 3 - Home Field Advantage?
#### Lists all teams, and their win stats, and deviations form expected performances during Home and Away games to see if a Home Field Advnatge had a role in their win/Loss Performances
